# Oblata-Display

Oblata Display is a high-contrast serif typeface with a subtle classical touch and expressive ligatures.
Designed by Astrid Schäfer, it’s ideal for headlines, logos, book covers, and other attention-grabbing text. 

The font includes standard Latin characters, ligatures, and a kerning system.
Hinting has been intentionally left out to preserve the elegance of the letterforms at display sizes.
Tested with FontBakery – all critical checks passed.
